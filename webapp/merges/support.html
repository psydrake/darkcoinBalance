	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<ul>
		<li id="FAQ_why_does_my_balance"><p><strong>Why does my balance in Darkcoin Balance look slightly lower than the balance shown in my wallet?</strong></p>
			<p>
			<strong>Darkcoin Balance</strong> examines the literal addresses you enter and reports the balances from the <a href="http://explorer.darkcoin.io/chain/DarkCoin/">blockchain explorer</a>. However, I have found that if I send coins from my QT wallet to an external address, the wallet can also shuffle some small number of coins (or fractions of coins) into an internal address. I've read that there are about 100 such addresses generated by the wallet for storing &quot;spare change.&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
			Basically this means that if your balance in <strong>Darkcoin Balance</strong> looks off, it is probably because some of your balance has been moved to a hidden address in your wallet - in my experience, as a result of an attempted send transaction. However, none of your coins have been lost.
			</p>
			<p>
			You can find the hidden address(es) by following these instructions for the QT wallet:
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <code>Help -> Debug Wallet</code> in the Wallet menu</li>
				<li>Click on the <code>Console</code> tab</li>
				<li>There should be a command prompt at the bottom of the window. Enter:
					<code>listaddressgroupings</code> and press <code>RETURN</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					It should give you a list of addresses and balances - for example:
					<pre>
 [
    [
       ["XrXLBfbmGSLoU1biw7nnqbdyziJ9GSxV5A", 0.11900000],
       ["Xxxas33JP8ri2G1TeAGNymqWvfYr1eY7aY", 10.79535900, "Purchases"]
    ],
    [
       ["XfXsE4mmjFCfZ1gAcP8vLsjdYDucNTEAnE", 2.92520266, "Mining"]
    ]
 ]
					</pre>
					Notice that there is an address, <code>XrXLBfbmGSLoU1biw7nnqbdyziJ9GSxV5A</code> in this case (yours will be different), that was created by the wallet without a label.
				</li>
				<li>Add that address into the <strong>Darkcoin Balance</strong> app. The balance shown should now match that shown in your Darkcoin QT wallet.</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p>Because of this wallet behavior, if you need total accuracy, I've found it more practical to use <strong>Darkcoin Balance</strong> with addresses from a wallet from which I don't do a lot of sending - e.g. the wallet that holds my mining address from a mining pool, or a buy-and-hold address that I use to withdraw from a currency exchange - as opposed to a wallet from which I'm doing active sending of funds.</p>
			<p>Alternately, you could add all the hidden addresses to <strong>Darkcoin Balance</strong> as you discover them using the above technique.</p>

	<h2>What is Darkcoin?</h2>
	<p>
		Darkcoin is the first anonymous digital currency (a digital version of cash). When sending Darkcoin, you choose whether the transaction is private or public.
		Your Darkcoin are stored in a digital wallet that you own and control. Transactions are anonymous "from the wallet" meaning you don't have to trust a third party 
		to make the transaction private.
		Check out the <a href="https://www.darkcoin.io/">Darkcoin website</a> to find out more!
